-> Open Source Container Orchestration Tool
-> Automating the deployment, scaling and deploying containers
- Self-healing
    - auto-scaling
    - auto-restart

CONTAINERS
- virtualize the underlying OS instead of virtualizing the hardware
  -> Lightweight and portable
- Isolated from each other
  -> separated filesystems
  -> Limit resources

DECOUPLED SYSTEMS
- containers are decoupled from the underlying infrastructure and from the host filesystem
  ( portable across cloud infr.)

MONOLITHIC (?)

MICROSERVICES
- application are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically

KUBERNETES ARCHITECTURE
- Master/Controller

  -> Minion (1-N) = (Nodes)
     - Runs DOCKER

     -> PODS (1-N)
        - Running CONTAINER (1-N)
